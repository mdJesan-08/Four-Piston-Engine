# Four-Piston Engine CAD Assembly & Motion Study

This project showcases my first journey into CAD design. I started by learning from a [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/NZCMTK9VTSQ?si=QTNRLZ_cYnI4o3_J), where I assembled a four-piston engine and later performed a motion study to visualize how the components interact.

## ðŸ”§ Project Overview

* Modeled the main components: **piston, crankshaft, connecting rod, and engine block**.
* Assembled the parts into a complete **four-piston engine**.
* Performed a **motion study** to simulate th assembly, and motion analysis**.


## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Open the assembly file in your CAD software (e.g., SolidWorks).

## ðŸ“š Lessons Learned

* Importance of **mates/constraints** in assemblies.
* How to detect and fix **interference and misalignment**.
* Basics of **kinematics in CAD** through motion simulation.
* Value of starting small in CAD and gradually building complex systems.
